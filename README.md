## My process

- The main container should be a flexbox
  - Flex set to one so that each item take equal space
  - flex-wrap:column
- The flex children should stretch to fix the whole space

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- ```css
  html,
  body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
  ```
  - set html height to 100% to fill all the page

- ```css
  margin-top:auto;
  ```
  - set the margin-top:auto can make the element at the end of the flexbox
### Continued development

To make the three buttons align on a line
